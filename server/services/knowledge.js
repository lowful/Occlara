/**
 * The Pro Playbook: a tagged, queryable library of proven high-elo Valorant
 * habits (distilled from Radiant, Immortal, and pro play). Instead of pasting
 * the same static list into every prompt, retrieve() scores each note against
 * the CURRENT match situation (agent, map, side, phase, economy, weapon,
 * streaks) and returns only the most relevant few, so a Jett on Ascent attack
 * in a force buy gets Jett, Ascent, attack, and force buy knowledge.
 *
 * Growing the playbook needs NO code changes:
 *   - add entries to PLAYBOOK below, or
 *   - drop extra entries into server/data/playbook.json (same shape), which is
 *     merged at startup. That file is where knowledge extracted from coaching
 *     videos and pro VODs lands (transcribe, extract rules with an LLM, tag,
 *     append). The coach is smarter on the very next request.
 *
 * Note shape (every tag optional; untagged notes apply everywhere):

 * ── ADVANCED MODE, AND WHY IT IS NEVER 100% ADVANCED ────────────────────────
 *
 * A note is `tier: 'advanced'` when it teaches something a player already doing
 * the basics can use: a damage breakpoint, a utility timing, a read across
 * rounds. Everything else is core, which is the default, so the 357 hand
 * written notes stay exactly as they were.
 *
 * With the toggle ON the mix tilts hard toward advanced, but a FLOOR of core
 * notes always survives, and that floor is the whole point rather than a
 * hedge. Advanced advice assumes the fundamentals are in place. A player who is
 * dying on repeat does not need a damage breakpoint, they need to stop walking
 * into open ground, and a coach that answers a fundamentals problem with theory
 * is worse than one that says nothing.
 *
 * THE DEATHSTREAK OVERRIDE is that idea with teeth. situationOf already raises
 * `deathstreak` at two deaths in a row, which is the cheapest available signal
 * that whatever the player is doing is not working. On that flag the reserve
 * INVERTS: core takes the majority back until they stop dying. Nothing about
 * this is configurable, because a player who turned advanced mode on is exactly
 * the player who would not turn it off while losing.
