/**
 * The health a player died with is not health they still have.
 *
 * When a player dies, the server strips the health number before it is sent,
 * because the number on screen now belongs to the spectated teammate (see
 * test-alive-claims). The client merge then skipped the absent field and left
 * the player's LAST-ALIVE health sitting in match context.
 *
 * That number is not inert. The server decides whether to coach a living player
 * with `alive === true || hp > 0`, so a context of { playerAlive: false,
 * playerHp: 100 } resolves to ALIVE, and the prompt told the model:
 *
 *   "THE PLAYER IS ALIVE RIGHT NOW, at 100 HP, and is playing this round.
 *    Do NOT review a death..."
 *
 * while the player sat watching a killcam. Every deliberate guard downstream is
 * built on the client and the server agreeing about whether the player is
 * breathing, and this quietly broke that agreement on every frame after a death.
 *
 * Run: npm run test:deathhp

  //
  // First, it contradicted the server, which has always dropped the health for
  // this exact tell ("the tell wins and the health number is DROPPED rather
  // than reassigned, because it belongs to somebody else"). So the combination
  // this asserted on could not reach the client in production at all; the test
  // only saw it because it feeds the engine directly.
  //
  // Second, it is the bug. In a real graded session the player's genuine first
  // death was rejected twice with "said the player was dead while they were
  // alive at 100 HP", because the spectator camera puts the SPECTATED
  // teammate's health in the same corner of the screen. Health is only ground
