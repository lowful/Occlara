/**
 * Grade the Rivals HERO READ against real capture frames.
 *
 * This measures the one thing that decides whether live Rivals tips can ship.
 * Everything downstream (the switch call, the moment gate, the glyphs) is
 * offline-testable and already passing. None of it is worth anything if the
 * coach cannot tell who is on screen, and until now that read had never been
 * measured: a wrong hero surfaced only as a slightly odd sentence, which is
 * unfalsifiable.
 *
 * `/api/rivals/identify` exists so the read can be asked for on its own, with
 * no coaching attached, and compared against what a human says is in the frame.
 *
 * SETUP
 *   1. Put frames in fixtures/rivals/ (gitignored: they are pictures of
 *      someone's screen and this repo is public).
 *   2. Write fixtures/rivals/heroes-truth.json:
 *        { "scoreboard-1.jpg": { "mine": "Iron Man",
 *                                "enemy": ["The Punisher", "Groot"],
 *                                "ally":  ["Luna Snow"] } }
 *      Only list heroes YOU can see in the frame. A hero you left out counts
 *      against precision if the model reports it, which is the point.
 *   3. OCCLARA_LICENSE=<key> node scripts/verify-rivals-heroes.js
 *
 * WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN
 *   recall     of the heroes really there, how many were found. Low recall
 *              costs coverage: fewer tips, none of them wrong.
 *   precision  of the heroes reported, how many were really there. Low
 *              precision is the dangerous one, because a hallucinated enemy
 *              hero is what produces a confident, wrong switch call.
 *   side       of the heroes correctly named, how many were put on the right
 *              team. "Switch, they have two hitscan" is wrong if the two
 *              hitscan are your own team.
 *
 * PRECISION IS THE GATE. Recall can be poor and the feature still ships,
 * because rivals-heroes.js already treats an unknown hero as silence. Precision
 * cannot: there is no downstream guard that catches a hero who was never there.
