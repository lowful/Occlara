/**
 * Screenshot any renderer surface so a design change can be LOOKED AT rather
 * than only compiled.
 *
 * shot-splash.js already does this for the launch animation, and the rebrand
 * made the gap obvious: every other surface could only be verified by reading
 * CSS and hoping. A palette edit that silently drops a declaration, a font that
 * falls back because its weight is not shipped, and a logo stretched by a
 * changed aspect ratio all pass every automated check in this repo and are
 * instantly obvious in a picture.
 *
 * Dev tool, never shipped: electron-builder only packages src/ and assets/.
 *
 *   npx electron scripts/shot-surface.js panel settings stats
 *   npx electron scripts/shot-surface.js onboarding@2 onboarding@3 settings
 *   npx electron scripts/shot-surface.js --all
 *
 * name@page shoots one page of a paged surface, counted from 0 as its
 * data-page is, so onboarding@3 is the Riot ID page. It is written to
 * name-page.png. NOT name:page: an argument shaped like onboarding:2,
 * followed by any other argument, makes Electron exit before this script
 * runs a line, with no output, from Git Bash and PowerShell alike.
