// purpose, and throws the sentence away while keeping the field it trusts.

// off nothing is asked, and with heroCapture on the route IS asked while no
// draft tip escapes.
//
// This block is LAST and asynchronous, and the summary below lives inside its
// continuation. Written first as a bare top level `return`, which in CommonJS
// exits the module: every later check silently never ran, the summary never
// printed, and the file still exited 0. A test that reports success without
