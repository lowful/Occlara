 * Valorant map knowledge stays true for years; Rivals rebalances constantly, and
 * a coach confidently naming last season's best pick is worse than one that says
 * nothing about heroes at all. So the tier list expires and the fundamentals do
 * not, and the coach is built on the half that never rots.
