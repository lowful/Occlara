# Nothing reaches the screen during a match

Moved out of CLAUDE.md word for word, nothing reworded or dropped (CLAUDE.md as of commit cc1f880, 8.5.0, lines 14 to 66). Sections here: "Nothing reaches the screen during a match, in any game". "Above" and "below" in the text name sections that may now sit in another file under docs/claude/: grep the section's title there to find it. The table in CLAUDE.md says which file to read for which work.

## Nothing reaches the screen during a match, in any game

Occlara used to show live tips. They are **removed**, not paused, since 8.0:
the overlay window, the voice coach, the tip library, tip history, tip styles,
force tip and explain tip are gone from the code, and so is the switch that
used to close them. Do not add any of it back, and do not add anything else
that tells a player what to do while they play.

Riot's VALORANT developer policy lists as unapproved "in-game apps and overlays
that include any real-time data that would improve a player's performance
immediately by altering player behavior (i.e. 'go here now'), vs altering it
upon reflection, learning and coaching the player game over game". A player got
a one week ban with the app flagged as third party. The anti-cheat axis (screen
capture like OBS) was always clean; the written policy was not. League's policy
is stricter still (see below). The second half of that sentence is the product.

What still counts as "reaching the screen", and is sealed mid match:

- The main window shows no page at all mid match, only a Recording screen, and
  its sidebar's pages are locked (`syncSeal`, below under The UI), because an
  open page on a second monitor is the same live feed. A stop in the middle of
  a match holds that seal until the player opens a page.
- The corner mark, the always on top crescent the window leaves at the top
  right of the screen while it is hidden, goes while the seal is on, live or
  held, and comes back once it lifts with the window still hidden (8.3.2,
  `placeMark` in index.js, `check:seal`). It showed nothing, but it sat over
  Valorant's kill feed, and the window is hidden exactly while a match is
  played.
- The AI log seals the live session (`liveLogSealed`), because an open log on a
  second monitor is a live feed of the match by another name. Frame chat refuses
  it, and Ask Coach answers nothing mid match: the question is refused before
  any request is made (8.5.0, `ask-coach.js`, `MID_MATCH`), its one time fill
  waits, and a review saved after a stop mid match is held from it (below,
  "Ask Coach knows the match it is asked about"). A
  review's eye (below) does nothing mid match, and its read of one match is
  sealed the same way when that match is in the live session. The seal is
  decided on the session a read would serve, never the id asked for, and an id
  the log no longer keeps is gone, never replaced by the newest folder, which
  mid match is the session being recorded.
- Ctrl+Shift+E opens the last review, and does nothing while a match is in
  progress (`matchInProgress()`).
- The window's notice line, in the top strip and shown only when there is
  one, carries notices only (a licence ending, capture blocked, the server
  down) and the paused line, never anything about the match.
- The update's restart question waits while the player is playing
  (`updater.js`, `busy` from index.js: a session running, a stop mid match
  holding the seal, or a review still being built, `reviewBeingBuilt`, for
  the hour its match is held at most). It came up whenever the download
  landed, over the game mid round and in agent select, and "Restart now" quit
  the recording and the review being checked with it. It is asked again
  every 30 seconds until then, and names the newest version downloaded
  meanwhile, the one a restart installs (`test:updater`).
