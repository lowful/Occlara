/**
 * The games Occlara can coach.
 *
 * One place that answers "what is this app currently about": the name shown to
 * the player, the palette, and, importantly, whether coaching for it actually
 * exists yet. Before this file the answer was implicit, scattered across a
 * hardcoded `game: 'Valorant'` string in two payloads and a require of
 * valorant-data.generated.json at four call sites.
 *
 * `coaching: false` is the honest half of this. A game can be present in the
 * registry, and have a finished palette, long before its coach works. Shipping a
 * picker whose second option silently runs Valorant logic under a different
 * colour scheme would be worse than shipping no picker at all, so an
 * unavailable game is hidden from players entirely and only appears when
 * devGames is switched on in the config.

    // better, so it is not a legibility problem.

    // 1. Riot's Data Dragon publishes every champion, ability and icon per
    //    patch for third-party use. The "never a portrait" rule written for
    //    Marvel Rivals is a TRADEMARK constraint on NetEase art and it does NOT
    //    carry over here: League can ship real champion icons. Separate from
    //    that is Riot product registration and approval for a PAID product,
    //    which is a permission to obtain rather than a data problem.
    //
    // 2. Riot documents a Live Client Data API on 127.0.0.1:2999 that hands
    //    over exact champion names, scores and events during a match. The thing
    //    that blocks Rivals, knowing who is on screen, does not exist here.
    //    That is a decision to take deliberately rather than drift into,
    //    because it is a NEW KIND OF INPUT for a product whose promise is "we
    //    only capture the display". It is not memory reading, not file access
    //    and not input automation, so it does not break that promise, but the
    //    promise has to be restated rather than quietly widened. It is the Live
    //    Client Data API on 2999, NOT the LCU, which Riot says is unsupported
