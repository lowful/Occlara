/**
 * NOT WIRED, AND NOT THE META THE COACH USES. Read this before using it.
 *
 * The meta the coach actually reads is META in server/services/rivals-knowledge.js,
 * which is a hand written snapshot carrying its own patch stamp and is reached
 * through knowledge.block(). This file is a SECOND meta implementation that
 * nothing calls, and two meta implementations that do not talk to each other is
 * the real hazard here: the next person to want a meta fact has an even chance
 * of picking the one that is never consulted.
 *
 * WHAT IS MISSING is not a call site, it is the data. Every function below
 * expects a snapshot shaped { patch, fetchedAt, heroes: { name: { winRate } } },
 * and nothing in this repo produces one. Nothing can: every Rivals win rate
 * source was evaluated and rejected, the reasons are tabulated in
 * docs/AI-CONTEXT.md, and the plan's instruction is explicit. Either a snapshot
 * is hand authored once per patch, or this file goes.
 *
 * It is kept rather than deleted because the reasoning in it is sound and
 * expensive to rediscover: bands rather than decimals because two tier lists
 * disagreed by three points on the same hero on the same day, and the player's
 * own record outweighing the meta. Both of those are worth having written down
 * whoever ends up implementing them.
 *
 * So: do not wire this expecting it to work. Produce the snapshot first.
 *
 * ── What it would do, once it had data ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * How good is a hero, and how good is it FOR THIS PLAYER.
 *
 * Two different questions, and the second one is the reason this file exists.
 * A tier list is public information that any website gives away; the coach's
 * value is knowing that the player averages 0.7 K/D on the S-tier pick and 1.4
 * on the B-tier one. Reading a tier list back at someone is not coaching.
 *
 * THE GOVERNING RULE: the player's own record usually outweighs the meta. A
 * strong hero played badly loses to a mediocre hero played well, and telling
 * someone to pick the season's best character when they cannot play it is how a
 * coach gets ignored. Meta strength breaks the tie when the player has no
 * record either way, and it earns a mention when the gap is genuinely large.
 *
 * META DATA HAS A SHELF LIFE, which is the other half of this file. Marvel Rivals
 * patches frequently: Season 9.5 landed on 7 August 2026, nerfed the highest
 * win rate hero in the game, buffed several underdogs and added a new Vanguard.
 * Tier data from before a patch is not merely old, it is confidently wrong, and
 * a coach citing it sounds authoritative while being out of date. So every
 * reading carries the patch it came from and goes quiet once it is stale, the
 * same way the Valorant coach refuses a callout it cannot verify.
 *
 * Public sources also disagree with each other. Two tier lists on the same day
 * put the same hero at 59.1% and 56.3%. That spread is wide enough that precise
 * numbers should never be quoted to a player; the BAND is the honest unit.
