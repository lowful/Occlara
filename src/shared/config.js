// Two quality profiles: standard is plenty for HUD reading and uploads fast;
// high sends a sharper frame (bigger upload + more image tokens per call, so
// slightly slower replies, but zero effect on game FPS since capture runs in
// a worker thread).
// THE COACH READS SMALL TEXT, so the frame has to carry it. Health, the round
// timer, the scoreline and the printed location label are only a few pixels tall
// at 480p, and those four fields are what every guard in the engine is built on.
// 720p is the point where they are comfortably legible; going beyond that buys
// nothing a HUD reader needs and costs upload time and image tokens on every
// frame, so "standard" stops there rather than chasing resolution.
//
// "performance" is the old 480p profile, kept as an explicit choice for players
// on weaker machines or thin connections. It is a real trade: the coach reads
// the HUD less reliably, and the setting says so.
