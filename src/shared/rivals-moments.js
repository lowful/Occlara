/**
 * NOT WIRED, because there is no live Rivals tip stream for it to gate.
 *
 * This file answers "when may a live tip appear", and the Rivals engine does
 * not send live tips. It probes for two screens, hero select and the end of
 * match scoreboard, two to five captures a match, and each one produces at most
 * one sentence. There is no stream to gate, so the gate has nothing to do.
 *
 * THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT, it is what the capture frames settled. The events
 * this file keys on, a death, a team wipe, an objective flip, are read out of a
 * kill feed that nothing currently captures. Wiring it would mean adding a
 * continuous capture loop to a game whose whole coaching design is that it does
 * not need one, and the reasoning below is exactly why that loop would be a bad
 * trade: a hero shooter fight is continuous, and a tip that lands mid fight is
 * either ignored or it gets someone killed.
 *
 * Kept rather than deleted because the rule it encodes is right and was arrived
 * at the hard way from the other direction, as the note about the Valorant death
 * review below records. If live Rivals coaching is ever built, this is the gate
 * it should be built behind rather than one rediscovered later.
 *
 * ── What it gates, if a live stream ever exists ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHEN a live Rivals tip is allowed to appear.
 *
 * Valorant tips ride a timer because a Valorant round has long stretches where
 * a player is walking and can read. A 6v6 hero shooter has almost none: the
 * fight is continuous, and a tip that lands mid-fight is either ignored or it
 * gets someone killed.
 *
 * So Rivals does not stream tips at all. It waits for one of a small number of
 * MOMENTS, each chosen because the player is provably not shooting and the
 * screen is showing something unambiguous:
 *
 *   death        respawn timer is up, they are watching a killcam, and they are
 *                about to choose whether to switch. This is the single most
 *                valuable moment in the game to say anything at all.
 *   teamWipe     nobody is contesting, everyone is walking back in
 *   objective    a point flipped, the pace resets for a few seconds
 *   roundStart   staging before contact
 *
 * This is the same rule that governs the Valorant death review, arrived at from
 * the other direction: there, silence had to be ADDED after a death. Here,
 * speech has to be EARNED.
 *
 * Pure and DOM free so the whole gate is testable offline.
