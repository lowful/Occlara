/**
 * Which map was actually being played, across a logged session.
 *
 * A session often covers several matches, and the obvious way to find the
 * boundaries is to watch the model's map read change. That is wrong, and the
 * logs say so plainly. Across five real sessions the model reported:
 *
 *     Sunset x119, Bind x3, Lotus x3      (one match, score 1-0 up to 12-5)
 *     Haven  x65,  Lotus x5, Bind x1      (one match, score 0-0 up to 4-4)
 *     Sunset x49,  Haven x6, Bind x1      (one match, score 0-0 up to 5-3)
 *
 * Every one of those sessions was a SINGLE map. Splitting on a map change would
 * have cut them into seven, nine and eight matches. This is the same failure the
 * map lock exists for, arriving here through the log rather than through a tip.
 *
 * So matches are not found from the map read at all. They are found from the
 * SCOREBOARD, because a new match starts at 0-0 and the score otherwise only
 * climbs. Within a match the map is then decided by two independent methods that
 * must agree:
 *
 *   1. the model's own reads, taken as a plurality over the whole match rather
 *      than frame by frame, so three bad frames cannot outvote a hundred good
 *      ones
 *   2. mapFromLabels, the rarity-weighted fingerprint built from the location
 *      names Valorant prints on screen, which is the more reliable of the two
 *      and is what the engine itself trusts over the model
 *
 * When they disagree the labels win, matching the engine, and the segment is
 * reported as unconfirmed so the interface can say so rather than assert it.

// per death and then goes quiet until the next buy phase, so a death during the
// silence leaves no mark at all. Measured on a real session that showed 5 review
// markers, the player actually died 9 times.
//
// Deciding it from the frames instead needs care in BOTH directions, because
// both errors were found in the same session by opening the screenshots:
//
//   - the "KILLED BY <enemy>" combat report stays on screen through the end of
//     the round and into the next buy phase. Three frames showing a living
//     player at full health carried that panel, so anything keying off it
//     invents deaths that already happened.
//   - the health number belongs to the SPECTATED teammate while dead, so a
//     confident "100 HP" is not evidence of being alive.
//
// The signal that actually separates them is the spectator interface: SWITCH
// PLAYER, a killcam, or watching a named player. That is what is required here.

// dependable sign of being dead. A person or the spectator UI, not the
