/**
 * The Marvel Rivals coach.
 *
 * Same event surface as coaching-engine.js, deliberately, so the controller, the
 * overlay and the AI log need no special case for which game is running. What is
 * completely different is the cadence.
 *
 * Valorant reads a frame every ten seconds, roughly 360 an hour, because a
 * positional read stays true for a few seconds and then does not. Rivals is a
 * chaotic 6v6 where moment to moment position is noise, and the decisions that
 * settle the game are discrete: what you pick, and when you switch. So this
 * engine captures on STATE CHANGE rather than on a clock, which works out at two
 * to five captures a match instead of hundreds, and costs on the order of one
 * percent as much to run.
 *
 * The cost of that design is that a missed draft is a missed match, since hero
 * select lasts under a minute. Hence the fast probe below: a cheap poll looking
 * only for the draft screen, which stops as soon as it finds one.
