/**
 * Reading the AI decision log: list the kept sessions, open one of them.
 *
 * Split out from the writer so it can be tested without Electron, because the
 * two rules that matter here are both invisible when they break:
 *
 *   - the picker must NOT carry frames. A session holds 2 to 12MB of JPEG,
 *     which base64 inflates by a third again, so listing five sessions eagerly
 *     would push 30MB+ through a single IPC call to fill a dropdown. Metadata
 *     comes from log.json alone, at roughly 50 to 100KB a session.
 *   - the session id arrives from a renderer, so it is matched against the
 *     folder listing rather than joined onto a path.
 *
 * Every function takes the root explicitly and keeps no state, so a test can
 * point it at a fixture directory.

 *
 * `live` is the session being recorded right now, and it MUST be excluded.
 * A live session has no log.json until its first frame lands, so without this
 * it matches the empty rule exactly. Between 3.3.0 and 3.9.0 the caller created
 * the folder and pruned on the next line, which deleted the session it had just
 * started; every frame after that wrote into a path that no longer existed and
 * the error was swallowed by the "a dropped frame is not worth interrupting
 * coaching" catch. Two weeks of decision logs went missing in silence, and the
 * only symptom was the log window showing nothing newer than the release.
