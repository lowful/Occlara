/**
 * The two sounds the app makes: coaching armed, and coaching stood down.
 *
 * Played by the panel on its status transitions (panel.js soundCue), and only
 * when config.sounds is not false. The overlay played them until 8.0 removed
 * it, and for a while after that nothing did.
 *
 * Synthesised rather than shipped as files, for three reasons that all matter
 * here. The panel's CSP is `default-src 'self'` with no media-src, and Web
 * Audio needs no source at all, so this cannot be blocked. Nothing is added to
 * the installer. And the shape of the sound is in the code, where it can be
 * tuned by ear against the game rather than by opening an audio editor.
 *
 * The brief was "cool, and fits the vibe", and the vibe is a tactical shooter,
 * so these are not notification chimes. Arming is a mechanical latch and a
 * rising perfect fifth: something engaging. Standing down is the same interval
 * falling, with a low body under it: something releasing. Both are under a
 * third of a second, because this plays over a game somebody is concentrating
 * on and a sound that outstays its welcome once will be muted forever.
